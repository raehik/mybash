1) EVERYTHING IS A FUNCTION
	Functions are nice. Functions can have local variables. And functions
	can be called later if necessary - even better, if they DON'T need to
	be called later, they can be unset after being run. So they very much
	help keep your profile neat and understandable, as well as highly
	modular.

2) APACHE-LIKE CONFIG CONFIG
	You might want to disable a config just for a while because you're
	doing a certain thing, or you're testing a config and need an easy
	way to enable and disable it. The functions 'mybash-enconf' and
	'mybash-disconf' will do just that. The idea is taken from Apache's
	very simple website and mod configuration - two folders exist,
	'confs-available' and 'confs-enabled'. The latter stores symlinks to
	mods you want enabled. 'main' will read all .confs in the 
	'confs-enabled' folder.
	
	Note that 'mybash-enconf' and 'mybash-disconf' can be disabled
	themselves, but through manual editing of the 'main' file. If they are
	disabled, 'main' can be modified as you would normally the .bashrc
	file - by sourcing files you want.

3) THIS STUFF ISN'T ACTUALLY WORKING YET
	but it will be eventually.
