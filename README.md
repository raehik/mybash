MyBash
======

Allows easy configuration of Bash profile variables. MyBash comes with multiple universal and specialised configs, and only Bash knowledge is needed to create your own.

Essentially, it neatens up Bash shell startup files by keeping all user settings separate from the main .bashrc (for easy moving between users/computers) and making it possible to enable and disable them easily.

Installation
------------

    curl -s https://raw.github.com/raehik/mybash/master/install -o /tmp/mybash-install ; bash /tmp/mybash-install

If you don't want to use the installation script, follow these steps:

1.  download the repository anywhere you like
2.  source the file 'main' in your shell profile
3.  restart your shell
