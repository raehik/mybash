MyBash
======

Allows easy configuration of Bash profile variables. MyBash comes with multiple universal and specialised configs, and only knowledge of Bash scripting is needed to create your own.

Essentially, it neatens up Bash configuration by keeping all user settings separate from the main .bashrc (for easy moving between users/computers) and separating custom functions, prompts, etc, making it possible to enable and disable them on the fly.

Installation
------------

    curl -s https://raw.github.com/raehik/mybash/dev/install -o /tmp/mybash-install ; bash /tmp/mybash-install

If you don't want to use the installation script, follow these steps:

1.  download the repository anywhere you like
2.  source the file 'main' in your shell profile
3.  restart your shell
